  <h1>Micro/Nanostructured Surfaces</h1>
  <p>
    For centuries, Nature has inspired humans with its elaborate and intrinsic surface structures. 
    Such biological structures are often not only visually appealing, but also have vivid engineering 
    functionality or even multi-functionality. Fundamental understanding of such natural surfaces, 
    both in terms of structures and how it relates to overall functionality gives us the opportunity 
    to learn and mimic some of Nature’s designs. Recent advances in micro-/nano-fabrication and 
    coating technologies have enabled us significantly in that direction, leading to the development 
    of smart engineered surfaces. At the Smart Energy and Thermal Transport Research Lab, we are 
    working towards developing a better understanding of overall functionality due to surface 
    micro/nanostructures, chemical heterogeneity, and physical conditions. These studies are critical 
    for elucidating the underlying physical mechanisms behind the other research topics being 
    investigated in our lab. For instance, the liquid-solid interfacial interactions dictate the fate 
    of liquid droplets impacting a solid surface. For phase change processes such as condensation, 
    boiling, and evaporation, surface characteristics plays a dominant role in heat transfer performance.
